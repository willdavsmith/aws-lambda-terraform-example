      The `Radius.Compute/functions` resource type deploys a serverless function instance. Use it in your application Bicep to bind a function to an application/environment and set the image and auth behavior.

      Example:
      ```
      extension radius
      param environment string

      resource myApp 'Applications.Core/Applications@2023-10-01-preview' = { ... }

      resource fn 'Radius.Compute/functions@2025-08-01-preview' = {
        name: 'hello-func'
        properties: {
          application: myApp.id
          environment: environment
          image: 'ghcr.io/your-org/hello-func:latest'
          location: 'westus2'
        }
      }
      ```

      After deployment, the function emits a `url` property you can expose via connections or outputs.
